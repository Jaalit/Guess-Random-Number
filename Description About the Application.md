Welcome to my Guess Random Number software. It is a simple guess game. Program take the number from user and the compare with Math.random's creating number.

----------------------
V0.1
  This software comes from Java language and work at Java ide.
  In this software we are use Math.random(), if-else and while.
  Basicly this software is a mini-game.

v0.2
  To add excitement to the gameplay, I added a line in which we have a certain number of lives.
    "int live = 5;"
  In 'while()' statement i set the 'live--;' so if your guess is wrong your lives decreasing -1.
  When I'm playing the game, even I get excited about whether I'm going to find it.
